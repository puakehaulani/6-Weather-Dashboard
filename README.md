## About the Project

**Weather Dashboard** is Homework 6 for UW Coding Bootcamp. We were given a [User Story](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-08-2020-u-c/blob/master/class-content/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-Homework/README.md#user-story) and [Acceptance Criteria](https://uwa.bootcampcontent.com/UWA-Bootcamp/uw-sea-fsf-pt-08-2020-u-c/blob/master/class-content/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-Homework/README.md#acceptance-criteria) to follow.  
Our task was to create a dynamic weather dashboard using Open Weather Map's API.

This project focused on utilizing APIs to display relevant infomation to a user without having to code the information from scratch. It required we learn to read API documentation, call an API, receive the response, and then parse the response to pull out the information we wanted.

### Built With

[Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, enter a city name in the search box and click the search icon. The dashboard will display the city name with date and an icon to represent the current weather conditions, as well as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for the city. Below, it will display a 5 day forecast for the city. The sidebar below the search bar will display all the recent cities that were searched for. The conditions of the last city searched for will display when the dashboard loads.
